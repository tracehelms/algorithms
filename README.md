# Algorithms

These are my implementations of various algorithms and data structures. Currently it's in TypeScript but I might add more languages in the future.

Each file should have a comment talking about the performance. And each one should have a test case using a large dataset (a 10,000 length array, for example) where the result is timed and logged for demonstration.

Work in progress.
